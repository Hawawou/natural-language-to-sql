# natural-language-to-sql
This project aims to develop a system that converts natural language questions into SQL queries, enabling non-technical users to query databases easily. The task is fundamental in applications such as chatbots, voice assistants, and user-friendly database interfaces. The system will be built using the WikiSQL dataset, which includes tables, natural language questions, and their corresponding SQL queries.

Objectives
- Implement a Text-to-SQL conversion system to transform natural language into SQL queries.
- Experiment with different models such as pre-trained transformers or sequence-to-sequence models.
- Evaluate performance using standard metrics like exact match accuracy and execution accuracy.
- Analyze the system's strengths and weaknesses to suggest improvements.
